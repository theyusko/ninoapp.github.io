## Nino is not OCR
Note taking amounts to an important part of studying materials for many students, be
they grade school or graduate students. In many cases, there are no lecture notes or slides
readily available, or the ones that are available do not cover all of the lecture content. This
requires students to take notes during the lecture.

However, in some cases, the student has to note down the words fast without truly
processing their content, or write down equations without having the time to analyze and
thus understand them. In the case of writing down sentences, one can achieve faster note
taking with tablets/computers, but when the lecture notes consist of plots, graphs or
mathematical equations, our market research shows that there is no hardware/software
help to achieve faster note taking than writing it down .

So, we made Nino. 
Nino is a note taking system in itself. It is a mobile app that converts handwritten or printed
notes into an editable format. It is unique in the way it reads more than only alphanumeric 
characters; hence, Nino Is Not OCR. Give Nino any note with text, mathematical equations, 
plots, trees, UML diagrams, you name it, and watch it create a digital version of it.
 
Nino is used in the following way: the user will upload or take a photo, then the system will
detect and reproduce the notes in a digital format, while also suggesting a category for the 
note. Users will be able to change, add or delete categories of the notes. They will also be
able to edit and search through the notes. 
For enhancing the learning process, Nino provides users with text summarization mainly from 
keywords extracted from the text; it will also connect technical terms to its respective
Wikipedia page.
When the user is satisfied with the notes (or maybe puzzled by the notes), Nino let’s them share
the notes or export them in LaTeX or pdf format. 
You can trust Nino in taking good care of your notes.
